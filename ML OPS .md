For a straightforward image recognition task with a focus on rapid deployment, you would need a stack that allows for quick development, easy integration with your existing backend and frontend, and the ability to scale if needed. Here's a suggested open-source MLOps setup:

1. **Model Development and Training**:
   - **TensorFlow** or **PyTorch**: Use one of these frameworks to develop and train your image recognition model. They are well-supported and have extensive resources and pre-trained models available.

2. **Experiment Tracking**:
   - **MLflow**: For tracking experiments, managing the model lifecycle, and packaging the model for deployment.

3. **Feature Store (if needed)**:
   - **Feast**: Although for image recognition you might not need a sophisticated feature store, if your workflow requires this component, Feast can help manage features.

4. **Model Serving**:
   - **TensorFlow Serving** or **TorchServe**: Depending on the framework you chose for training, use the corresponding tool to serve the model as a web service.

5. **Orchestration and Workflow Management**:
   - **Kubeflow Pipelines**: If you plan to scale up and need to manage complex workflows, Kubeflow Pipelines can be a good choice, especially if you are already considering Kubernetes for deployment.
   - **Airflow** or **Prefect**: For simpler workflow orchestration that can handle scheduling and automation of your ML pipelines.

6. **Data Storage and Versioning**:
   - **DVC**: To version and manage datasets and model binaries, ensuring reproducibility.

7. **Model Monitoring and Observability**:
   - **Evidently AI**: To monitor the model's performance and detect any data drift or anomalies in production.

8. **Deployment and Infrastructure**:
   - **Docker**: Containerize your model serving application to keep the environment consistent and portable.
   - **Kubernetes**: For orchestrating and managing your Docker containers, if needed.

9. **Backend Integration**:
   - Since youâ€™re using Firebase, you can deploy your containerized model serving application to **Google Cloud Run**, which integrates easily with Firebase and allows you to scale to zero when not in use, saving costs.

This stack emphasizes flexibility, rapid development, and open-source tools. With TensorFlow or PyTorch, you can leverage many pre-built models for image recognition which you can fine-tune for your specific case. MLflow can manage the machine learning lifecycle, and TensorFlow Serving or TorchServe can efficiently serve the model. Evidently AI will help you keep tabs on your deployed model's performance, and Kubeflow or Airflow can manage your ML workflows if they become complex. DVC will assist in data and model versioning, and Docker and Kubernetes are industry standards for deployment and scaling.

Integrate these with your Firebase backend and Flutter frontend by setting up the proper API endpoints, and you should have a robust system for your hackathon project.
